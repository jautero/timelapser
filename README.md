This is some code I wrote to make timelapse video on my netbook.

USAGE
=====

Start both `netf.py` and `movie.sh`. `netf.py` takes a picture every 10 seconds
and stores it in a `image*nnn*.jpg` file. `movie.sh` generates MPEG movie of
those images and displays it in loop full screen. Movie is regenerated whenever
there are more than 24 new frames generated.
